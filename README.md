# ratom-notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/libratom/ratom-notebooks/master)

A selection of Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate features of [libratom](https://github.com/libratom/libratom) and other utilities developed for the RATOM project.

***These example notebooks are under development***

## Using ratom-notebooks (simple)

The simplest way to interact with these notebooks is via [**mybinder**](https://gke.mybinder.org/), which automatically builds an executable environment you can interact with from a web browser. The following link will generate an environment from this repository:

[https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/libratom/ratom-notebooks/master](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/libratom/ratom-notebooks/master)

Sample data from the redacted Enron email corpus will be automatically downloaded when this instance is created. You can view the sample files in the RevisedEDRMv1\_Complete folder that appears in the **Files** tab of the Jupyter instance.

In the **binder** folder, youâ€™ll find three Jupyter notebooks:

**pst\_walk.ipynb**, a simple example demonstrating walking a PST file using libpff to identify the number of messages present.

**message\_viewer.ipynb**, which examines the contents of a PST file.

**entities.ipynb**, which identifies all of the entities present in every message body and commits them to a sqlite3 database. Note: this is intended to be run on a local or dedicated hosted instance; running this notebook in mybinder may be slow.

After clicking on the mybinder link above, you'll see a loading page; loading may take several minutes. Once the environment has started, you'll be taken to a directory listing where you can click on the desired .ipynb file to view it in a new tab. In the menu within this tab, click on Cell -> Run All to run the entire notebook. Individual code cells are labeled with their purpose and intended output.
